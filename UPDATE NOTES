### Update Notes (September 4, 2024):

- **WHOIS Lookup Feature Added**: The `--whois` parameter has been introduced. This allows a WHOIS lookup to be performed before the subdomain scan begins. This feature enables users to view domain registration information prior to scanning.

- **Screenshot Capture Functionality Enhanced**: The `-ss` parameter has been added. With this parameter, users can specify a specific HTTP status code. When a subdomain returns the specified status code, the tool will automatically capture a screenshot of that subdomain.

These updates significantly enhance the tool's functionality and usability, providing more flexibility and detailed information for domain analysis.

### SubScanX Update Notes
**Date: 2024-09-06**
**New Features:**
- **Technology Detection:**

 Added a new `--detect-tech` parameter that identifies the technologies used by subdomains (CMS, server types, JavaScript frameworks, etc.).
 This feature runs after the HTTPX results and reports technology information for each subdomain.
- **Enhanced Visualization:** HTTPX results and technology detection outputs are displayed separately to avoid confusion.

**Improvements:**

- **HTTPX Results:** Improved error handling and timeout management during HTTPX requests, ensuring better management of failed connections and retries.
- **Screenshots:** The screenshot capture feature is improved when using the `--screenshot-status` parameter to capture screenshots of subdomains with specific HTTP status codes.

**Bug Fixes:**

- **SSL Errors:** Better error messages and retry mechanisms for SSL handshake failures and timeout errors.

- **Subfinder Integration:** Improved handling of network connection errors during subdomain scanning.
